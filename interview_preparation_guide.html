					<h1>Interview Preparation Guide</h1>
				</header>
				<P>Great news for all you interview candidates - there’s plenty you can do on your own to
					walk into an interview feeling prepared and confident. I’ll guide you through a
					detailed, step by step approach that, once you review and practice, will make the
					process feel more
					manageable - and even help ease your nerves!</P>
				<P>Now, you might be thinking, "But I get REALLY nervous talking to a stranger who's deciding my
					future!" That’s completely normal! Nerves actually serve a purpose - they’re your body’s way of
					getting you ready for something important. That surge of adrenaline can sharpen your focus, boost
					your energy, and keep you alert. The key is learning to channel that energy in a positive way. How?
					Preparation! When you prepare, you give your brain a clear structure to follow, which helps calm
					your nerves and increases your chances of success.</P>
				<P>So, where do you start?</P>
				<OL>
					<LI>
						<P><strong>Research the Organization</strong></P>
						<P>
							Whether it is a professional job, a college interview, a part time position, taking a little
							time to learn about the organization can make a big difference.
							<BR>
						<UL>
							<LI>Understand the organization’s mission, values, and culture.</LI>
							<LI>Look at recent news, press releases, and industry trends.</LI>
							<LI>Review the job description and key responsibilities.</Li>
						</UL>
						</P>
					</LI>
					<LI>
						<P><strong>Know the Role</strong></P>
						<P>
							Understanding the role’s requirements will help you confidently answer
							questions like, <B>“Why do you think you’re a good fit for this position?”</B>
						<UL>
							<LI>Identify the key skills and experience needed.</LI>
							<LI>Prepare real-life examples that highlight your strengths. (For example,
								if you’re a leader, think of a time you took initiative or
								guided a team.)</LI>
							<LI>Understand how this role contributes to the organization’s goals and how
								you can add value. (Consider how your skills will help the
								company succeed.)</LI>
						</UL>
						</P>
					</LI>
					<LI>
						<P><strong>Resume & Cover Letter Review</strong></P>
						<P>
							Think of your resume and cover letter as your formal introduction - they give
							employers a clear picture of who you are, what you can do, and why you’re a great fit.
						</P>
						<P><strong>Resume:</strong> A structured summary of your skills, experience, and
							education.</P>
						<P><strong>Cover Letter:</strong> A personalized message (sometimes optional but
							highly
							encouraged) that explains your interest in the job and how you’re a
							strong candidate.</P>
						<UL>
							<LI>Keep your resume up to date and error-free.</LI>
							<LI>Highlight relevant experiences, skills, and achievements.</LI>
							<LI>Tailor your cover letter to match the specific job and company.</LI>
						</UL>
					</LI>
					<LI>
						<P><strong>Prepare for Common Interview Questions</strong></P>
						<P>
							You may be surprised to learn that while the number of interview may feel endless, in
							reality, they are not. They may be worded differently, they may be more specific to the
							role, but most of them actually focus on a few key themes.
						<UL>
							<LI>What are your skills?</LI>
							<LI>How do your skills match the job requirements?</LI>
							<LI>How do you fit within the team and the organization?</LI>
						</UL>
						</P>
						<P>Since you won’t be the only candidate, it’s important to prepare answers that help you stand
							out. Here are some common questions you might encounter: </P>
						<UL>
							<LI>"Tell me about yourself."</LI>
							<LI>"Why do you want to work here?"</LI>
							<LI>"What are your strengths and weaknesses?"</LI>
							<LI>"Describe a challenge you faced and how you handled it."</LI>
							<LI>"Where do you see yourself in five years?"</LI>
						</UL>
					</LI>
					<LI>
						<P><strong>Behavioral & STAR Method Preparation</strong></P>
						<P>
							When you answer interview questions in a structured way, you help create a
							clear, complete picture for the interviewer, rather than just offering a
							vague answer. For example, simply saying, <B><I>"I'm a reliable person who
									follows through on my commitments"</I></B> sounds nice, but it doesn't give
							enough context to show how your reliability will help you succeed in the role you're
							applying for. It also doesn't demonstrate real-life experience to back up your claim.
						</P>
						<P>To give your answers more impact, use the STAR method:</P>
						<UL>
							<LI><strong>Situation:</strong> Set the context.<BR>Example: <I>"At my part-time
									job at XYZ Restaurant..."</I></LI>
							<LI><strong>Task:</strong> Describe your responsibility.<BR>Example: <I>"I worked as a
									hostess..."</I></LI>
							<LI><strong>Action:</strong> Explain what you did.<BR>Example: <I>"My manager often
									relies on me to cover shifts when a coworker calls out..."</I></LI>
							<LI><strong>Result:</strong> Share the outcome.<BR>Example: <I>"Because they know I’ll
									show up on time and get the job done."</I></LI>
						</UL>
						<P>Putting it all together:</P>
						<P><i>"At my part-time job at XYZ Restaurant working as a hostess, my manager
								often relies on me to cover shifts when a coworker calls out because they
								know I’ll show up on time and get the job done."</i></p>
						<P>This method not only paints a clearer picture but also shows the interviewer
							that you have hands-on experience to back up your claims.</P>
					</LI>
					<LI>
						<P><strong>Technical or Job-Specific Questions</strong></P>
						<P>
							The previous example was a basic answer, but many roles require specific skills that need
							more detailed, technical responses. In order to prepare:

							<BR>
						<UL>
							<LI><strong>Review industry-related knowledge and skills</strong> to ensure you're up
								to date on the latest trends and best practices.</LI>
							<LI><strong>Prepare for technical assessments or case studies</strong> that might be
								part of the interview process.</LI>
							<LI><strong>Practice subject matter skills</strong> (e.g., coding, design, technical
								writing), problem-solving, or role-specific tasks so you can confidently demonstrate
								your expertise.</Li>
						</UL>
						</P>
					</LI>
					<LI>
						<P><strong>Prepare Questions for the Interviewer</strong></P>
						<P>
							Always have two or three thoughtful questions ready to ask the interviewer at the end of the
							interview. It shows your genuine interest in the role and the company. Make sure your
							questions are specific to the position and organization to help you stand out.
							<BR>
						<UL>
							<LI>"What does success look like in this role?"</LI>
							<LI>"Can you describe the team’s work culture?"</LI>
							<LI>"What are the biggest challenges in this position?"</Li>
							<LI>"What’s the next step in the hiring process?"</Li>
						</UL>
						</P>
						<p>These questions not only help you gather useful information but also reflect your proactive
							attitude and curiosity.</p>
					</LI>
					<LI>
						<P><strong>Mock Interviews & Practice</strong></P>
						<P>
							While practicing in your head or in front of a mirror is better than nothing, practicing
							with someone else significantly increases your chances of success. Here's how to get
							started:
							<BR>
						<UL>
							<LI><strong>Write things down first.</strong> Prepare notes on the questions you
								expect to be asked and write out your STAR answers. Also, list any questions you want to
								ask the interviewer.</LI>
							<LI><strong>Review regularly.</strong> Go over your questions and answers often so
								you become more comfortable. Don’t try to memorize everything - just
								focus on remembering key points to trigger your memory during the interview.</LI>
							<LI><strong>Conduct mock interviews.</strong> Practice with a friend or mentor to
								simulate a real interview setting.</Li>
							<LI><strong>Record yourself.</strong> Answer questions while recording and review the
								video to see how you can improve.</Li>
							<LI><strong>Focus on clarity and confidence.</strong> Practice speaking clearly and
								confidently to ensure you come across as composed and professional.</Li>
						</UL>
						</P>
						<p>By putting in the effort to practice, you’ll feel more confident and prepared when it’s time
							for the real interview.</p>
					</LI>
					<LI>
						<P><strong>Dress Appropriately</strong></P>
						<P>
							Whether the interview is in person or a virtual one, first impression is key! Dressing
							appropriately helps set the tone for a professional interview and shows that you take the
							opportunity seriously.
						<UL>
							<LI><strong>Choose professional attire</strong> that aligns with the company culture.</LI>
							<LI><strong>Ensure your outfit is clean, ironed, and fits well</strong> to help you look
								polished and confident.</LI>
						</UL>
						</P>
					</LI>
					<LI>
						<P><strong>Logistics & Planning</strong></P>
						<P>
							Imagine the stress of arriving at an interview only to realize it was supposed to start an
							hour earlier, or trying to join an online interview, only to find out your microphone or
							webcam aren’t working. Planning ahead can help reduce that anxiety!
						<UL>
							<LI><strong>Confirm the interview date, time, and location</strong> (or video link)
								to avoid any confusion.</LI>
							<LI><strong>Test your internet connection, webcam, and microphone</strong> ahead of
								time to make sure everything works smoothly for a virtual interview.</LI>
							<LI><strong>Arrive Early</strong> - plan your commute and arrive at least 10-15
								minutes early.</LI>
						</UL>
						</P>
					</LI>
					<LI>
						<P><strong>Body Language & Communication</strong></P>
						<P>
							Your goal is to make a great impression throughout the interview, and both verbal
							communication and body language play a huge role in how interviewers remember you.
						<UL>
							<LI><strong>Maintain good posture and make eye contact</strong> to show confidence and
								engagement.</LI>
							<LI><strong>Listen actively</strong> and avoid interrupting to demonstrate respect and
								focus.</LI>
							<LI><strong>Speak clearly and concisely</strong> to ensure your message is understood
								and comes across professionally.</LI>
						</UL>
						</P>
					</LI>
					<LI>
						<P><strong>Follow up</strong></P>
						<P>
							Since interviewers often meet with several candidates, following up after your interview is
							a great way to stand out.
						<UL>
							<LI><strong>Send a thank-you</strong> email within 24 hours.</LI>
							<LI><strong>Reiterate your interest</strong> in the role and express gratitude for the
								interviewer’s time.</LI>
							<LI><strong>Mention key takeaways</strong> from the interview to reinforce your fit
								for the position.</LI>
						</UL>
						</P>
					</LI>
